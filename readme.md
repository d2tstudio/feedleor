# Feedly
Everyone needs Feedly. Here is the other half of the Meteor oAuth package for Feedly authentication.

## Don't shoot the messenger
As I said in the readme of the sister package to this one (d2tstudio:accounts-feedly) - I'm not a *real* programmer, I'm a designer. So, although I have tested this, and it did work. You know the score, things can happen. In short I will help if I can by tweeting me @derrybirkett

## Dependencies
Apart from those detailed in the package.js this package *needs* its sister package as mentioned above. Otherwise it does nothing. I repeat, nothing. It's a bum, it can't get out of bed, but when it's with its lover - well, it's a film.

Onwards, to glory!
